Welcome to ACADIA
ACADIA is an Artificial Computer Assisted Document Improvement Application. Our purpose is to help users improve their documents by providing a score and suggestions for improvement.

How it works
Users can upload their documents to our application, which then sends the document to our server for scoring. The score is determined by analyzing the document for grammar, accuracy of steps, and other categories. Once the document has been scored, suggestions for improvement are provided to the user.

In addition to document scoring, ACADIA also provides support and advice through a chatbot feature.

Future Capabilities
In the future, we plan to expand our capabilities to include:

Language translation for documents in different languages
Integration with popular word processing software for seamless document editing
AI-driven recommendation engine to suggest documents and content
