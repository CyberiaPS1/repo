Slimeboi

Slimeboi is a 2D side-scrolling game developed using Python and Pygame. The game features a character that can move, jump, and interact with a parallax scrolling background. The character's color changes based on the layer it is in, and the game includes a simple point system that increases the score when the character is in the special layer.
